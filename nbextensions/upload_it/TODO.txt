# TODO list for Upload it extension

The following tasks are open and are waiting for contributors
to implement them:

* Report the error if the upload was not successful,
  perhaps suggest checking if the upload URL is correct.

* Parse the response from the server (note: server implementation
  may not be ready yet) and open the check/submission report
  link in a new browser tab.
